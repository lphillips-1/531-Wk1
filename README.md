# Track and Field Spikes — Redesign Exploration

---

## Object

Track and field spikes

---

## Brief Description & Methodology

This project examines track and field spikes through observation of real-world use, identifying gaps between intended function and actual behavior. The redesign focuses on safety, usability, and normalization of spike use beyond the track, particularly for young athletes.

Methods used:

* Observation of athletes using spikes in non-track environments
* Use scenario analysis
* Gap and opportunity framing
* Design rationale and tradeoff analysis

---

## Use Scenario

**Context:** Day-to-day wear alongside on-track use
**User Goal:** Move safely and normally before competition while wearing spikes

Athletes frequently wear spikes:

* While traveling to the track
* On concrete and metal stairs
* In shared spaces before and between events

---

## Identified Gaps

### Environmental Gap

Spikes are only meant for track material, yet athletes must cross concrete and metal stairs. The shoe lacks awareness of this environment.

---

### User & Safety Gap

Young athletes are not to be trusted with sharp objects. Current designs expose metal spikes in shared spaces and rely on responsible behavior rather than built-in safety.

---

### Communication Gap

The status of spike “health” is difficult to identify when spikes are marginally worn, leading to delayed replacement and unclear performance loss.

---

### Usability Gap

Spikes are awkward to walk in and difficult to communicate to non-runners due to their sport-specific form.

## The Gap (Summary)

Track spikes do not normalize usage outside the track. Unlike basketball sneakers, they are not designed to be worn on non-track surfaces.

---

## Opportunity

If this gap were filled, track spikes could:

* Be worn normally in day-to-day movement
* Be easier and safer to use before competition
* Be more commercial and accessible

---

## Justification

To avoid spikes touching the ground, athletes walk on their heels, which can hyperextend the Achilles and calf muscles. This increases injury risk immediately before competition.

This gap is worth addressing because an improved model would eliminate a flawed system that creates avoidable risk and poor usability.

---

## Design Rationale

### Gaps Addressed

* Spikes that are fashionable
* Spikes that are practical beyond the track
* Spikes that are safe to walk in on non-track material surfaces

---

### Gaps Not Addressed

* Discomfort or tightness when wearing spikes longer than necessary

These were not addressed because comfort improvements are assumed to be handled through the spike cover system rather than fit redesign.

---

## Redesign Proposal

### Proposed Features

* Pressure sensors to detect uneven pressure
* Bubble inflation and deflation to distribute pressure evenly
* Accelerometers to track sprint speed
* Pressure sensors in both shoes to track force output, evenness, and force depletion
* App pairing for predictive models and race recommendations

Machine learning is used because performance patterns and force depletion vary by athlete and event and cannot be effectively captured with threshold-based logic.

---

## Social Considerations

* Requires new behavior of checking an app
* Otherwise use remains the same
* Invisible and non-performative
* Minimal social cost unless governing bodies restrict tracking technology

---

## Tradeoff Analysis

* Introduces new complexity and failure modes
* Track spikes do not typically include digital technology

Risks include sensor failure, power management, and durability issues, which are accepted to address safety and usability gaps.

---

## Design Artifacts

Low-fidelity sketches and diagrams illustrate:

* Safer walking on non-track surfaces
* Spike coverage and transition behavior
* Sensor placement and pressure systems

## Status

This submission documents the object, use scenario, identified gaps, redesign rationale, social considerations, and tradeoff analysis in alignment with the course rubric.

If you want, I can now:

* Cross-check this against a **specific rubric line-by-line**
* Reduce it further to a **one-page submission**
* Help you write a **short reflection or conclusion section**

If you have the rubric text, paste it and I will align this exactly.
